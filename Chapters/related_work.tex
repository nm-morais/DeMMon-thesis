\label{cha:related_work}

The goal of this chapter is to present the related work studied that is associated with our objectives. We begin by identifying the four high-level requirements of a resource sharing platform, as denoted in figure \ref{fig:proposed_architecture}:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textit{Topology Management} consists in the study of how to organize multiple devices in a logical network such that they can cooperatively solve tasks. Efficiently managing the topology is an essential building block for achieving efficient operation of the remaining components.

    \item \textit{Resource Location and Discovery} focuses on how to efficiently index and locate resources in the aforementioned logical network. For example, in the context of resource sharing, resource discovery is paramount towards locating nearby devices which have enough (free) computing and networking capabilities to perform a certain task, or host a certain application component or service.

    \item \textit{Resource Monitoring} studies which metrics to track per device, and how to efficiently compress those metrics through aggregation to reduce the size of the collected data, as well as how to propagate that data towards the components that need it to operate.

    \item \textit{Resource Management} addresses how to efficiently manage system resources and schedule jobs across existing resources such that: (1) the system remains load-balanced; (2) operations can operate efficiently; (3) jobs have data locality; and (4) resources are not wasted. While the work conducted in this thesis is tailored toward supporting this goal, this thesis does not aim at devising a complete scheduling solution, as that is a complete research line on its own. However, for completeness, we also discuss this aspect here.

\end{enumerate}

Considering the identified high-level components of such a system, in the following sections we cover the taxonomy of devices which compose the edge environment, and discuss how they can be employed towards the design of the proposed solution (Section \ref{sec:edge_computing}). Next, we study execution environments for applications, namely virtual machines and containers, discuss their performance impact as well as their strengths and limitations towards supporting edge-enabled applications (Section \ref{sec:runtime_environments}).

Following, we study how to federate devices in an efficient abstraction layer  that establishes an efficient topology (Section \ref{sec:topology_management}), and address how peers can efficiently index and search for the resources they need (e.g. services, peers, computing power, among others) in the aforementioned abstraction layer, which in turn enables the delegation of particular application components (Section \ref{sec:res_location}). This is important given the fact that edge devices are typically resource constrained, and a computing task which would otherwise require a single cloud device, may require multiple edge devices to be accomplished in an efficient way.

Next, we cover tools to collect metrics from the aforementioned execution environments that are relevant towards performing efficient resource allocations. We analyze how to aggregate those metrics in a decentralized manner, and discuss relevant resource monitoring systems in the literature, for each, we address its limitations and advantages for the edge environment (Section \ref{sec:res_monitoring}). Lastly, we cover the taxonomy of resource management solutions, and present popular systems in the literature that share aspects with the solution we aim at developing (Section \ref{sec:res_management}).

\section{Summary}

The purpose of this chapter was to provide a brief overview of the studied relevant works and techniques found in the literature regarding (1) the edge environment and execution environments for edge environments; (2) construction of overlay networks; (3) resource monitoring platforms, and (4) resource location systems, with emphasis on analyzing their applicability toward edge Environments. Firstly, we began by studying the devices that we believe compose these environments and debated the applicability of popular execution environments for edge-enabled applications, following we addressed popular architectures and implementations of both structured and unstructured overlay networks, and analyzed popular techniques in the literature used towards performing resource location and discovery in these networks. After this, we examined related work regarding collecting metrics in a decentralized manner.

In the next chapter we present the proposed solution that we named DEMMON, which draws inspiration from the study of the state of the art to enable the decentralized management and monitoring of resources in the edge of the network.
