\chapter{Related Work}
\label{cha:related_work}

The goal of this chapter is to present the work in the state of the art that is related to our objectives. We begin by presenting what we believe to be four main high-level requirements of a decentralized resource sharing platform, as denoted in Figure \ref{fig:proposed_architecture}:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textit{Topology Management} consists in the study of how to organize multiple devices in a logical network such that they can cooperatively solve tasks. Efficiently managing the topology is an essential building block for achieving efficient operation of the remaining components.

    \item \textit{Resource Location and Discovery} focuses on how to efficiently index and locate resources in the aforementioned logical network. For example, in the context of resource sharing, resource discovery is paramount towards locating nearby devices which have enough (free) computing and networking capabilities to perform a certain task, or host a certain applicational component or service.

    \item \textit{Monitoring and aggregation} studies how to track device metrics and how to efficiently compress the size of those metrics through (possibly decentralized) aggregation. Then, the compressed result may be used to improve the operation of a certain service or component.

    \item \textit{Resource Management} addresses how to efficiently manage system resources and schedule jobs (including hosting services, running a single task, among other types of jobs) across existing resources such that: (1) the system remains load-balanced; (2) jobs can operate efficiently; (3) jobs have (preferably) data locality; (4) resources are not wasted. While the work conducted in this thesis is tailored toward supporting this goal, this thesis does not aim at devising a complete scheduling solution, as that is a complete research line on its own. However, for completeness, in this chapter, we also discuss this aspect.

\end{enumerate}

% Next, we study execution environments for applications, namely virtual machines and containers, discuss their performance impact as well as their strengths and limitations towards supporting edge-enabled applications (Section \ref{sec:runtime_environments}).

Considering the identified high-level requirements of such a system, and considering the goal of creating such a system for the edge environment, in the following sections we begin by covering the taxonomy of devices that compose the edge environment and discuss how they can be employed towards the design of the proposed solution (Section \ref{sec:edge_computing}). 

Following, we study how to federate devices in an efficient abstraction layer that establishes an efficient topology (Section \ref{sec:topology_management}), we address how peers can efficiently organize to index and search for the resources they need (e.g. services, peers, computing power, among others), which in turn enables the delegation of particular application components (Section \ref{sec:res_location}). 

% This is important given the fact that edge devices are typically resource constrained, and a computing task which would otherwise require a single cloud device, may require multiple edge devices to be accomplished in an efficient way.

Next, in Section \ref{sec:res_monitoring}, we cover the current state-of-the-art regarding the collection and aggregation of metrics, which are paramount to summarize and enrich nodes with the necessary information to perform efficient resource management decisions in a decentralized manner. We study current aggregation practices and discuss relevant resource monitoring systems in the literature. For each system, we address its limitations and advantages for the edge environment. Lastly, as we believe it is necessary to gather a perception of the needs of current state-of-the-art resource management solutions, in Section \ref{sec:res_management} we briefly survey the related work in this area.

\section{Summary}

The purpose of this chapter was to provide a brief overview of the studied relevant works and techniques found in the literature regarding (1) the edge environment and execution environments for edge environments; (2) construction of overlay networks; (3) resource monitoring platforms, and (4) resource location systems, with emphasis on analyzing their applicability toward edge Environments. Firstly, we began by studying the devices that we believe compose these environments and debated the applicability of popular execution environments for edge-enabled applications, following we addressed popular architectures and implementations of both structured and unstructured overlay networks, and analyzed popular techniques in the literature used towards performing resource location and discovery in these networks. After this, we examined related work regarding collecting metrics in a decentralized manner.

In the next chapters, we present the proposed solution, that we named DEMMON, which draws inspiration from the study of the state-of-the-art to enable the decentralized management and monitoring of resources at both data centres and the edge of the network.
