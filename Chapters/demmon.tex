\chapter{DeMMON}
\label{cha:demmon} 

DeMMon (Decentralized Management and Monitoring Overlay Network) is an overlay network aiming to create logical connections among nodes integrating the network, forming multiple tree-shaped networks. Then, it provides an API to request information about nodes and services running in the system, which is collected on-demand by the monitoring protocol via efficient information aggregation and dissemination using the tree structure.

In this chapter, we will begin by explaining the targeted environment and the operation of the overlay network, whose tree shape is the basis for the aggregation protocol. After, detail how the aggregation protocol performs aggregations in the tree, and lastly, list the operations exposed by the API and discuss how it interacts with the remaining components. \todo{insert refs to subsections ahead}

This solution, as observable in figure \ref{fig:demmon-overview}, is composed of three major components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The overlay network, which strives to build a multi-tree-shaped network, nodes in this network use latency, node capacity, and a set of logical rules to change their location either from one tree to another or within their own tree.

    \item The monitoring protocol, which is a component that collects and disseminates information using the overlay network's established connections. It communicates via notifications and asynchronous request-replies with the overlay network to receive updates regarding established connections and connection failures. Lastly, it receives requests from the API to collect information.

    \item Lastly, the API receives updates from both the overlay network and the monitoring protocol, exposes the received information from those layers, and allows ingestion of new information. Furthermore, it allows issuing commands to collect new information, perform local aggregations periodically, or trigger issued alarms based on the respective conditions.
\end{enumerate}
