\chapter{DeMMON}
\label{cha:demmon} 

DeMMon (Decentralized Management and Monitoring framework) is a monitoring framework that aims to tackle the needs of decentralized resource management tools. These tools, as previously mentioned, must perform resource management decisions, such as load balancing or QOS optimizations, supported by partial and localized knowledge of the system. It is the goal of this framework, through the on-demand decentralized collection, aggregation, and storage of metrics in the form of time-series, to provide this knowledge base. We now detail what we believe to be the most common requirements of such tools:

\begin{enumerate} \label{enum:demmon}

    \item \textbf{Locality, by interacting with a partial set of nodes from the system}, optimized according to a certain proximity heuristic. This set is crucial such that a certain node has others to interact with to perform the aforementioned localized resource management decisions. In our framework, we chose latency as the heuristic for the proximity heuristic. The reasons for this choice were that not only does it does not rely on external tools, such as traceroute or a reverse IP-to-geolocation service, nor does it require pre-configuration of geolocation, making it possible for all nodes' configurations to be similar (thus making the deployment of large quantities of nodes easier). \label{enum:demmon_1}
    
     \item \textbf{Storage and querying of metric values}. As it is impossible to know ahead of time what type of information resource management systems and the functions to aggregate that information would otherwise require, we also believe that it is a requirement to \textbf{be as flexible as possible regarding metrics types and aggregation functions}. Furthermore, by allowing resource management systems to create custom-tailored metric formats tailored for their own needs, we believe it may even promote higher efficiency, as this feature may prevent inefficient workarounds from metric type restrictions. \label{enum:demmon_4}
    
    \item \label{enum:demmon_2} Ensure there are ways to \textbf{obtain the globally aggregate value of a metric distributed across one or more nodes in the system}, for example, the total number of nodes, service replicas, among others, without having to rely on a central component. This feature is important for resource management tools to, for example, maintain a (configurable) ratio of service replicas to nodes: by simultaneously collecting both the number of nodes in the system and the number of replicas, nodes can perform local decisions such as creating or decommissioning replicas, whenever the desired ratio of reaches a certain bound. Or alternatively, for example, for periodically collecting the number of nodes in the system to act as a configuration parameter for other systems. 
    
    \item Have a way to \textbf{obtain the aggregate value from a set of ``nearby'' nodes}. This feature is useful for decentralized resource management systems as it allows them to perform actions in a decentralized manner: by collecting the metrics relative to the usage of nearby nodes, each node may decide (e.g to improve a service's latency through proximity, to or reduce the load on a saturated service) to replicate or migrate service, motivated by this partial aggregate value. \label{enum:demmon_3}
    
    \item \textbf{Have a way to collect non-aggregated metric values from a set of ``nearby'' nodes}. Similar to item \ref{enum:demmon_3}, resource management frameworks may need to collect non-aggregated values to perform actions. In a service deployment context, it may want to collect the geographical positions of some nodes and deploy service replicas nearer to the current service clients' location. \label{enum:demmon_7}
    
    \item Provide ways to efficiently \textbf{propagate information} across nodes in the system. This is useful for resource management systems, as it prevents the overhead of establishing information propagation at the resource management layer. \label{enum:demmon_5}
    
    \item Ensure ways to \textbf{receive notifications based on issued alerts} that trigger whenever a supplied condition is met. This prevents clients of this system from resorting to periodically requesting/consulting information and performing the verifications themselves, saving unnecessary computation. By setting these alarms, resource management tools can, in turn, trigger resource management actions, for example, set an alarm that triggers if the mean of the CPU usage over the last N seconds reaches a certain threshold. When this alarm triggers, perform load-balancing or service migrations to spread the CPU load throughout nearby nodes. Furthermore, it is important to note that it is possible to create alerts on aggregated metric values. \label{enum:demmon_6}
    
\end{enumerate}

Having enumerated what we believe to be the requirements of such tools, we now provide a brief overview of the devised framework, which aims to fulfill these requirements. 

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:framework_overview}

The devised framework (illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:demmon-overview}) is coalesced by four main modules: the overlay network, the aggregation protocol, the API, and the monitoring module. In the following paragraphs, we describe each module's role within the framework and how they contribute to fulfilling the above-mentioned requirements.

\end{figure}
    
First, the \textbf{API} exposes the functionality of the framework, its main objectives are to (1) allow resource management solutions to collect metrics about nodes (or services they host) in the system; (2) allow those metrics to be queried through the use of a query language; (3) allow registering alarms which trigger based on conditions which evaluate the collected information. It is important to notice that the API is not the component tasked with gathering the information to perform these tasks. Instead, it exposes the results and mediates the interactions between the clients and the remaining modules.

Second, the \textbf{monitoring module} is tasked with storing metrics, resolving queries regarding stored metrics, removing expired metrics, periodically evaluating registered alarms, and triggering callbacks which the API then propagates to the client. This module satisfies points \ref{enum:demmon_4} and \ref{enum:demmon_6} of the aforementioned requirements.

The \textbf{overlay network} is responsible for building a latency-aware multi-tree-shaped network. Nodes in this network use latency, node capacity, and a set of logical rules to change their location either from one tree to another or within their tree until they have an optimized set of nodes (according to latency). The connections resulting from the operation of this protocol are the basis for the aggregation protocol. In addition, this module also offers limited horizon flood techniques, exposed through the API, fulfilling the points \ref{enum:demmon_1} and \ref{enum:demmon_5} of the requirements presented previously.

Finally, the \textbf{aggregation protocol} is a component that performs on-demand metric collection based on issued commands from the API. This component takes advantage of the overlay networks' established connections and hierarchical structure to perform efficient distributed aggregations. It allows three types of decentralized aggregation: (1) \textit{tree aggregation}, which consists of collecting metrics and merging them using the overlay protocols' trees, collecting a globally aggregated value in the tree roots (or a partial view of the system for nodes that are not the root of the overlay); (2) \textit{global aggregation}, where nodes also use their tree connections to efficiently collect a globally aggregated value (independently of being the root of the tree); and (3) \textit{neighbourhood aggregation}, where nodes collect values (non aggregated) of nearby nodes in term of hop proximity. These three mechanisms satisfy points \ref{enum:demmon_2}, \ref{enum:demmon_3} and \ref{enum:demmon_7} of the aforementioned requirements. 

In the following sections, we will begin by providing an brief explanation of the design and implementation of \textbf{GO-Babel} (section \ref{sec:GO-Babel}), a framework to build distributed systems' protocols (inspired in Babel~\cite{babel}), that we ported to Golang to ease the development of the overlay network. Following, we will provide a detailed explanation of the second contribution, composed by four modules. For each, we cover its' design and implementation, starting by the \textbf{overlay network} (section \ref{sec:overlay_network}), followed by \textbf{aggregation protocol} (section \ref{sec:mon_protocol}), and lastly, the \textbf{monitoring module} (section \ref{sec:mon_module}) and \textbf{API} (section \ref{sec:api}).

\section{Summary}

In this chapter, we covered the implementation of the DeMMon framework, a decentralized management and monitoring framework targeted for the operation of decentralized resource management systems. We began by covering what we believe to be the requirements of this solution (beggining of chapter \ref{cha:demmon}). Then, we detailed the implementation and design of Go-Babel (Section \ref{sec:GO-Babel}), which we used to develop the overlay network. Following, we provided a brief overview of the four modules which compose this framework, beginning with the overlay network (Section \ref{sec:overlay_network}), which is responsible for creating and maintaining a multi-tree shaped network, optimized using latencies and node capacity. Following, in Section \ref{sec:mon_protocol} we covered the aggregation protocol, which provides multiple primitives for collecting and aggregating metrics in a decentralized and efficient manner, using in-transit aggregation, from a partial (or complete) set of nodes in the tree-shaped network. Next, we covered the monitoring module (Section \ref{sec:mon_module}), which is the module responsible for enabling the storage and retrieval of metrics, parsing and processing queries and managing alarm lifecycles. Finally, we finished the DeMMon implementation by covering the API (Section \ref{sec:api}), which essentially is the module responsible for mediating, via a WebSockets interface, the aforementioned interactions between the external clients and the other modules.
