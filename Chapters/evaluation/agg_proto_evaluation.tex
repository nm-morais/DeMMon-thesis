In this section we present and analyze the obtained results from the experimental evaluation of the devised decentralized aggregation protocol when compared with a popular monitoting solution from the state of the art, named Prometheus \todo{cite}. We begin by providing the experimental setting and configuration settings used across the conducted experiments, after this, we present and discuss the obtained results from these experiments, and finish the section with a summary and the conclusions from the evaluation of our solution in this component.

As previously mentioned in section \ref{sec:mon_protocol}, the devised aggregation protocol offers three decentralized information collection primitives, neighborhood, tree and global aggregation. In this section we will provide the obtained results regarding the applicability of each of these features, however only the tree and global aggregation features will be compared with Prometheus given the solution does not provide a comparable feature to the neighborhood aggregation feature.

The experimental setting in which the experimental evaluation of our aggregation protocol was conducted in is the same as the one utilized to evaluate the membership protocol, where each solution is tested using containers in order to multiplex the physical nodes, isolate the running processes, apply bandwidth capacity constraints and latency delays.
