  abstract      = {Edge computing has emerged as a distributed computing paradigm to overcome practical scalability limits of cloud computing. The main principle of edge computing is to leverage on computational resources outside of the cloud for performing computations closer to data sources, avoiding unnecessary data transfers to the cloud and enabling faster responses for clients. While this paradigm has been successfully employed to improve response times in some contexts, mostly by having clients perform pre-processing and/or filtering of data, or by leveraging on distributed caching infrastructures, we argue that the combination of edge and cloud computing has the potential to enable novel applications. However, to do so, some significant research challenges have to be tackled by the computer science community. In this paper, we discuss different edge resources and their potential use, motivated by envisioned use cases. We then discuss concrete research challenges that once overcome, will allow to realize our vision. We also discuss potential benefits than can be obtained by exploiting the hybrid cloud/edge paradigm.},

Scribe is built on top of Pastry, a generic peer-topeer object location and routing substrate overlayed on the Internet, and leverages Pastry's reliability, self-organization and locality properties. Pastryi s used to create a topic (group) and to build an efficient multicast tree for the dissemination of events to the topic's subscribers (members).

% Cyclone, uses PREFIX and SUFIX to diminish routing tables
@inproceedings{Artigas2005,
  abstract  = {Recent research efforts have improved the existing flat Distributed Hash Tables to accommodate hierarchical structure. Nevertheless, many problems still remain to be solved regarding scalability issues, autonomous systems, connection degree, and network proximity. In this paper, we present a new Hierarchical DHT called Cyclone that aims to solve the aforementioned issues with a near-optimal architecture. Cyclone provides optimal logarithmic routing hops without establishing unnecessary connection links to other nodes. Our approach follows a horizontal and uniform leaf-based approach that considerably reduces the overall number of links per node. Furthermore, Cyclone also offers a disjoint multipath routing scheme that benefits from network proximity and thus creates a more robust overlay infrastructure. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

Our generic con struction, Canon, offers the same routing state vs. routing hops trade-off provided by standard DHT designs. The ad vantages of Canon include (but are not limited to) (a) fault isolation, (b) efficient caching and effective bandwidth us age for multicast, (c) adaptation to the underlying physical network, (d) hierarchical storage of content, and (e) hierar chical access control. Canon can be applied to many differ ent proposed DHTs to construct their Canonical versions. We show how four different DHTs - Chord, Symphony, CAN and Kademlia - can be converted into their Canonical ver sions that we call Crescendo, Cacophony, Can-Can and Kandy respectively.},

  abstract = {As Structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks become popular, there is an emerging need to monitor continuously the huge number of participants in a robust and scalable manner. To this end, aggregation has emerged as a basis for the self-management of these networks. However, the structured P2P networks lack today of efficient mechanisms for the decentralized computation of these aggregates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical theoretic model based on Cayley Graphs, which overcomes the requisite to accommodate growth without impacting the efficiency of distributed applications. Also, the paper presents an aggregation protocol that fuses the fault-resilience of gossip algorithms with the scalability of trees. In particular, simulation results show that this algorithm is capable to cope with the distributed and unreliable nature of P2P networks. {\textcopyright} IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2006.},

%Astrolabe
@article{Renesse2003,
  abstract = {Scalable management and self-organizational capabilities are emerging as central requirements for a generation of large-scale, highly dynamic, distributed applications. We have developed an entirely new distributed information management system called Astrolabe. Astrolabe collects large-scale system state, permitting rapid updates and providing on-the-fly attribute aggregation. This latter capability permits an application to locate a resource, and also offers a scalable way to track system state as it evolves over time. The combination of features makes it possible to solve a wide variety of management and self-configuration problems. This paper describes the design of the system with a focus upon its scalability. After describing the Astrolabe service, we present examples of the use of Astrolabe for locating resources, publish-subscribe, and distributed synchronization in large systems. Astrolabe is implemented using a peer-to-peer protocol, and uses a restricted form of mobile code based on the SQL query language for aggregation. This protocol gives rise to a novel consistency model. Astrolabe addresses several security considerations using a built-in PKI. The scalability of the system is evaluated using both simulation and experiments; these confirm that Astrolabe could scale to thousands and perhaps millions of nodes, with information propagation delays in the tens of seconds.},

@article{Cui2017,
  abstract = {Device to Device communication enables the deployment of mobile cloudlets in LTE-advanced networks. The distributed nature of mobile users and dynamic task arrivals makes it challenging to schedule tasks fairly among multiple devices. Leveraging the idea of software defined networking, we propose a software defined cooperative offloading model (SDCOM), where the SDCOM controller is deployed at the PDN gateway and schedules tasks in a centralized manner to save the energy of mobile devices and reduce the traffic on access links. We formulate the minimum-energy task scheduling problem as a 0-1 knapsack problem and prove its NP-hardness. To compute the optimal solution as a benchmark, we design the conditioned optimal algorithm based on the aggregated analysis of energy consumption. The greedy algorithm with a polynominal-time complexity is proposed to solve large-scale problems efficiently. To address the problem without predicting future information on task arrivals, we further design an online task scheduling algorithm (OTS). It can minimize the energy consumption arbitrarily close to the optimal solution by appropriately setting the tradeoff coefficient. Moreover, we extend OTS to design a proportional fair online task scheduling algorithm to achieve the fair energy consumption among mobile devices. Extensive tracebased simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of SDCOM for a variety of typical mobile devices and applications.},

Segmentation, distribution and adaptive deployment of functionalities over the continuum from Things to Cloud are challenging tasks, due to the intrinsic heterogeneity, hierarchical structure and very large scale infrastructure they will have to exploit. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet general, model to support the QoS-aware deployment of multi-component IoT applications to Fog infrastructures. The model describes operational systemic qualities of the available infrastructure (latency and bandwidth), interactions among software components and Things, and business policies. Algorithms to determine eligible deployments for an application to a Fog infrastructure are presented. A Java tool, FogTorch, based on the proposed model has been prototyped.},

We outline a conceptual framework for cloud resource management and use it to structure the state-of-the-art review. Based on our analysis, we identify five challenges for future investigation. These relate to: providing predictable performance for cloud-hosted applications; achieving global manageability for cloud systems; engineering scalable resource management systems; understanding economic behavior and cloud pricing; and developing solutions for the mobile cloud paradigm.},

@article{leitaoPHDthesis,
  abstract        = {The peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm has emerged as a viable alternative to overcome limitations of the client-server model namely, in terms of scalability, fault-tolerance, and even operational costs. This paradigm has gained significant popularity with its successful application in the context of file sharing applications. The success of these applications is illustrated by systems such as Napster, Emule, Gnutella, and recently, BitTorrent. In order to ensure the scalability of these solutions many P2P services operate on top of unstructured overlay networks, which are logical networks deployed at the application level. Unstructured overlay networks establish random neighboring associations among participants of the system. Although the random nature of these overlays is desirable by many P2P services, the resulting topology may present sub-optimal characteristics, for instance from the point of view of link latency. This may have a significative impact of the performance of P2P services executed over these overlays. This thesis focuses on the design and evaluation of techniques that manage the topology of unstructured overlay networks, to understand if and how it is possible to manage the topology of unstructured overlays in such a way that the random nature and low overhead that charac- terizes these overlays is not lost, while being able to impose some relaxed constraints over the topology to benefit the operation of specific P2P services. To answer this question, four different approaches to manage the topology of unstructured overlays are proposed and evaluated in the thesis. Each approach is evaluated in the context of a distinct P2P service that serves as a case study for measuring its benefits. In more detail, this thesis presents: i) CellFarm, a new overlay that combines properties of unstructured and structured overlays, to achieve a highly resilient topology composed of cliques of nodes, highly connected among themselves, that supports efficient replication for P2P systems; ii) X-BOT, a protocol to bias the topology of unstructured overlay networks given any criteria X; iii) Thicket, a protocol that efficiently embeds multiple interior-node-disjoint trees over a single unstructured overlay; and finally, iv) OpenFire, a protocol for balancing rumor mongering exchanges in networks populated by Firewalls and NAT-boxes.},
