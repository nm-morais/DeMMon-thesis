Scribe supports large numbers of topics, with a potentiallylarge number of subscribers per topic. Scribe is built on top of Pastry, a generic peer-topeer object location and routing substrate overlayed on the Internet, and leverages Pastry's reliability, self-organization and locality properties. Pastryi s used to create a topic (group) and to build an efficient multicast tree for the dissemination of events to the topic's subscribers (members). Scribe provides weak reliabilitygu arantees, but we outline how an application can extend Scribe to provide stronger ones.",

% Cyclone, uses PREFIX and SUFIX to diminish routing tables
@inproceedings{Artigas2005,
abstract = {Recent research efforts have improved the existing flat Distributed Hash Tables to accommodate hierarchical structure. Nevertheless, many problems still remain to be solved regarding scalability issues, autonomous systems, connection degree, and network proximity. In this paper, we present a new Hierarchical DHT called Cyclone that aims to solve the aforementioned issues with a near-optimal architecture. Cyclone provides optimal logarithmic routing hops without establishing unnecessary connection links to other nodes. Our approach follows a horizontal and uniform leaf-based approach that considerably reduces the overall number of links per node. Furthermore, Cyclone also offers a disjoint multipath routing scheme that benefits from network proximity and thus creates a more robust overlay infrastructure. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

We show how to construct hi erarchical DHTs while retaining the homogeneity of load and functionality offered by flat designs. Our generic con struction, Canon, offers the same routing state vs. routing hops trade-off provided by standard DHT designs. The ad vantages of Canon include (but are not limited to) (a) fault isolation, (b) efficient caching and effective bandwidth us age for multicast, (c) adaptation to the underlying physical network, (d) hierarchical storage of content, and (e) hierar chical access control. Canon can be applied to many differ ent proposed DHTs to construct their Canonical versions. We show how four different DHTs - Chord, Symphony, CAN and Kademlia - can be converted into their Canonical ver sions that we call Crescendo, Cacophony, Can-Can and Kandy respectively.},

% Making gnutella scalable: implements super-peers in gnutella 
@article{Chawathe2003,
abstract = {Napster pioneered the idea of peer-to-peer file sharing, and supported it with a centralized file search facility. Subsequent P2P systems like Gnutella adopted decentralized search algorithms. However, Gnutella's notoriously poor scaling led some to propose distributed hash table solutions to the wide-area file search problem. Contrary to that trend, we advocate retaining Gnutella's simplicity while proposing new mechanisms that greatly improve its scalability. Building upon prior research [1, 12, 22], we propose several modifications to Gnutella's design that dynamically adapt the overlay topology and the search algorithms in order to accommodate the natural heterogeneity present in most peer-to-peer systems. We test our design through simulations and the results show three to five orders of magnitude improvement in total system capacity. We also report on a prototype implementation and its deployment on a testbed.},
