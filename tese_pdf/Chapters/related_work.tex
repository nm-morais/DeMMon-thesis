\section{Context}

The following chapter provides context about to the challenge we attempt to solve and presents the identified sub-challenges towards performing management of microservices in the edge of the network. 

First, \textbf{microservice networking}: microservices need to cooperate towards solving applicational tasks, as such, peers in the system need to be integrated in an efficient abstraction layer that allows them to find each other and communicate. This raises an old challenge in P2P computing: how can peers organize themselves in the network such that they can find resources (e.g. other peers, services or even computing power) in an efficient way? It is important to notice that the edge environment is composed by lots of sub-networks composed of heterogenous devices concurrently entering and leaving the network, which presents a hard scenario in \textbf{resource location systems}, particularly in performing \textbf{topology management}, because the overlay needs to federate large numbers of devices and adapt to the underlying network in order to remain efficient. 

Addressing this, section \ref{sec:topology_management} of this chapter provides context about \textbf{topology management}, particularly the main categories of topologies and discuss their applicability in edge environments. Second section, \ref{sec:res_location} covers \textbf{resource location architectures}, which leverage on one (or a combination of) topologies to index resources in the system. For each type of architecture we discuss their differences and present popular implementations in the state of the art. 

Provided that we have an efficient overlay that we can employ towards deploying microservices, the next step is \textbf{ensuring and maintaining quality of service}. For this, we need to perform \textbf{monitoring} of device and service status, with a special emphasis on devices in the edge environment. Section \ref{sec:res_monitoring} covers popular techniques used towards tracking device and service status, we particularly study which metrics to collect that assist in pinpointing causes of QoS degradation. Furthermore, section \ref{sec:res_monitoring} also covers related work about monitoring edge devices and some examples of popular monitoring systems.

However, if we wish to gather metrics on device and service status, devices will produce a continuous stream of monitoring data, transmitting and storing that data becomes a limitation to the scalability of the system. To circumvent this, that data needs to somehow be combined, this is called \textbf{aggregation}. Section \ref{sec:aggregation} studies aggregation, which consists in the process of combining several numeric values into one single representative \cite{grabisch2009aggregation}. Next, we discuss the different types of aggregation, and how they can be applied towards maintaining the aforementioned quality of service.

Lastly, section \ref{sec:offloading_computation} studies how the aggregated results can be used to perform microservice management and deployment. Namely, how to orchestrate microservices such that the computation is offloaded to the Edge. We discuss paradigms such as Fog Computing and Osmotic Computing and how they compare to Edge Computing. Lastly, we discuss approaches towards implementing elastic computing in Edge environments.
