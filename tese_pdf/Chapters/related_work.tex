\chapter{Related Work} \label{cha:related_work}

The following chapter provides context about the related work done towards solving the identified challenges. First section introduces essential aspects about resource location systems, mainly studies most popular types of architecture used in these systems. For each type of architecture we present popular implementations in the state of the art and discuss their applicability in Edge Computing Environments. 

Second section addresses resource and service management, which is paramount towards maintaining QoS, especially in Edge devices that have limited capabilities. This section studies popular system implementations and discusses their advantages and disadvantages.

Third section studies aggregation, which is essential for handling the large flow of data originating from tracking device status and monitoring services. We study different types of aggregation protocols and discuss their strengths.

Second section discusses resource discovery,
