\chapter{Related Work} \label{cha:related_work}

The following chapter provides context about the related work done towards solving the identified challenges. First section introduces related work about resource location systems, mainly studies most popular types of resource location architectures. For each type of architecture we present popular implementations in the state of the art and discuss their applicability in Edge Computing Environments. 

Second section addresses resource and service management, which is paramount towards maintaining QoS, especially in Edge devices which have limited capabilities. We examine popular system implementations and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Third section studies aggregation, which is essential for handling the large flow of data originating from performing resource management. This section studies different types of aggregation protocols with an emphasis on protocols that leverage on hierarchical topologies to perform aggregation.

Fourth section discusses what type of resources are commonly collected towards service deployment. We study how to perform queries over large networks in order to find suitable devices that own enough resources for the service deployments. 

Finally, we address how computation can be offloaded to the Edge, discuss popular paradigms such as Fog Computing and Osmotic Computing and how they differ from Edge Computing. Lastly, we discuss  recent approaches towards implementing elastic computing in Edge environments.
