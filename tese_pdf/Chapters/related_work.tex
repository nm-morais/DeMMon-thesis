\chapter{Related Work} \label{cha:related_work}

In this chapter we provide further context about the Edge Computing paradigm and study related work to the identified challenges towards creating a unified infrastructure which performs monitoring and management of resources in the edge environment. First, we study the taxonomy of resources in the edge of the network, and describe how they can be employed (Section \ref{sec:offloading_computation}).

Then, after understanding the environment taxonomy, we describe common approaches towards integrating those devices in an efficient abstraction layer. It is paramount that such layer provides efficient communication patterns, traffic locality and load balancing (according to device heterogeneity). As such, we will cover the different techniques of topology management and present popular implementations (Section \ref{sec:topology_management}).

Following, we analyze how nodes can find resources (e.g. other peers, services or even computing power) in the aforementioned layer. We present popular implementations for each type of \textbf{resource location architecture}  in the state of the art (Section \ref{sec:res_location}). 

Next, we study how to \textbf{monitor} the state of the devices and the tasks running on them, we study popular techniques of monitoring device and task status, and how to aggregate those values (Section \ref{sec:res_monitoring}).

Lastly, we study how the monitoring data can be used to distribute and offload tasks. We discuss the differences between performing resource management in the Edge instead of the Cloud. Lastly, we discuss related towards offloading tasks  in Edge environments.
