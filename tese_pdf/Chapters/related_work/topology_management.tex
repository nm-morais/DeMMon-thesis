\textbf{Unstructured Overlay networks} 

are the second common approach towards build resource location systems, in this type of overlay, queries are supported using of dissemination techniques to find sets of nodes that own matching resources. Unstructured overlays usually impose little to no rules in neighboring relations, which results in a low maintenance overhead and high robustness to churn, but at the same time limited efficiency and scalability when performing exact resource location. 

Unstructured resource location systems usually resort to disseminating queries in the system using gossip techniques. Following we present some types of queries:
